# Game-Of-Life
This is my implementation of the Game of Life following [this walkthrough](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/); the program structure and many of the ideas where taken from there.  
It's a great challenge for beginners who know the basics of Python and want to experiment with something slightly more demanding.

It took me about 3 hours to have a functioning program and overall 10 hours to add more features, revise errors and adapt the logic.  
Use of LLMs was made for testing purposes or to improve readability and style where needed.

### How it works
The program is written in English but the print statements and user interface are in Italian.  
The _main.py_ file calls a few functions to create and visualize the game's board.  
The logic of the program is entirely handled inside _board.py_.

The user can launch the program inside a terminal by prompting the command `python main.py`.  
Once executed, follow instructions or press **Ctrl + c** to exit the program at anytime or when Life is dull.
